### How to run:

Type the command
	mvn clean install gwt:run

### What we have done

* We did a simple rest API, with GET commands
* We use the university MySQL database
* We have an incomplete GWT interface where you can search and create Persons

### Issues

The application compiles but does not run under windows. We did not spend time to resolve the issue.

### What is yet to be done

* Use Push commands
* Display Homes in the GWT interface
* Search by address in the GWT interface
* Edit a person in the GWT interface
* Make coffee
